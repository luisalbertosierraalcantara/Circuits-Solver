# Circuits-Solver
C++ DC circuits simulator. Can simulate basic circuits with resistances, current sources, and voltage sources. Uses Eigen for matrix computations. Written for a university group project, hopefully will be extended to alternating current circuits and more properly documented in the future. An operation manual is included.
