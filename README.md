# Circuits-Solver
Console-based C++ DC circuits simulator. Can simulate basic circuits with resistances, current sources, and voltage sources. Can compute thevenin equivalents and maximum power transfer and solve circuits by superposition. Uses Eigen for matrix computations. Written for a university group project, hopefully will be extended to alternating current circuits and more properly documented in the future. An operation manual is included.
